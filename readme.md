# One fruit a day

This is an example app that's used in a screen cast that shows how to store your application state in a localStorage when using a `Factory  Function` in JavaScript.

## Web Server setup

To use `localStorage` from Chrome you need to run a little `http-server` locally.

To install `http-server` from `npm` do this:

```
npm install -g http-server
```

After cloning this repository from GitHub change into it.

And the project root folder run the http-server:

```
http-server
```

This will start an http-server on port `8080` if that port number is available. If that port number see on the console on which port number the server is started on.

Open the site in a browser at: `http://localhost:8080` or at the appropriate port number.

To prevent any caching issues start the server with this command:

```
 http-servr -c-1
```
